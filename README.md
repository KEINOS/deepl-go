## üîë Obtaining a DeepL API Key

To use `deepl-go`, you need a DeepL API key:

1. Create a [DeepL account][deepl_signup_url].
2. Subscribe to a plan that provides API access (either Free or Pro).
3. Once subscribed, you will receive an API key, which you should keep private and use in your application as the authorization token.

**Note:** If your API key ends with `:fx`, it is recognized as a Free API key and the client will automatically use the free API endpoint.
A DeepL API Free account allows you to use up to 500,000 characters per month at no cost.
